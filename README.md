# cis4004

OBJECTIVE:
Create a full-stack web application on weather-related information for UCF's CIS-4004 course.

METHODOLOGY:
- Handling commits: GitHub
- Hosting: Microsoft Azure for hosting full-stack as we need back-end support (which github pages doesn't support unfortunately, unless you use a bunch of magic :/ ). Also allows us to do authentication!!!
- External API: Weather.gov for forecast API (thank you US gov for having this).
- Authentication: Google API
